## 1. Reading Rules

### 8 Tone Principles

1. **Warm but grounded** — thoughtful friend, not fortune teller
2. **Specific over vague** — reference actual numbers and tokens
3. **Honest about uncertainty** — state confidence %; name missing data
4. **Compassionate without flattery** — deliver shadow warnings with care
5. **Mathematical, not mystical** — reference calculations, not cosmic vibrations
6. **Suggestive, never predictive** — patterns, not prophecy
7. **Concise where possible** — no filler; "No strong patterns detected" if none
8. **Respect the person** — never pathologize a number

### Language Patterns

| Instead of...                  | Write...                                                              |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "The universe wants you to..." | "The numbers suggest a focus on..."                                   |
| "You are destined to..."       | "Your Life Path points toward..."                                     |
| "This is a bad day for..."     | "The shadow side of today's energy is... -- be mindful of..."         |
| "Your aura vibrates at..."     | "Your heartbeat rhythm maps to the Metal element, associated with..." |
| "The stars say..."             | "The planetary day (Moon) governs emotions and intuition"             |
| "You must..."                  | "Consider..." / "One approach might be..."                            |

### Disclaimers

**Standard:** This reading identifies patterns in numerical and temporal data using the FC60 encoding system, Pythagorean numerology, lunar phase approximation, and Chinese sexagenary cycles. It suggests themes for reflection, not predictions of future events. Use it as one input among many for self-awareness and decision-making. This is not a substitute for professional advice in health, finance, relationships, or any other domain.

**Short:** This reading suggests patterns, not predictions. Use as one input among many for reflection and decision-making.

**Low-Confidence Addendum (< 65%):** Note: This reading is based on limited data. The confidence score reflects the number of input dimensions available. Providing additional information (location, time of day, heart rate, mother's name) would increase the specificity and reliability of the analysis.

## 12. Signal Hierarchy

### 9-Level Priority

| Priority | Signal Source                     | Weight     |
| -------- | --------------------------------- | ---------- |
| 1        | Repeated animals (3+ occurrences) | Very High  |
| 2        | Repeated animals (2 occurrences)  | High       |
| 3        | Day planet (weekday ruler)        | Medium     |
| 4        | Moon phase                        | Medium     |
| 5        | DOM token animal + element        | Medium     |
| 6        | Hour animal                       | Low-Medium |
| 7        | Minute texture                    | Low        |
| 8        | Year cycle / Ganzhi               | Background |
| 9        | Personal overlays (numerology)    | Variable   |

### Conflict Rules

- Same-priority signals coexist — weave together, do not override
- Higher signal frames interpretation; lower signal adds texture, cannot contradict core message
- "Variable" personal overlays rise to Medium when they directly echo an animal archetype (e.g., LP 1 + Dragon convergence)
- **Day planet vs. Moon phase:** Frame the moon phase's action through the planet's lens
- **Hour animal vs. Day energy:** Layer them — the hour wraps the day's fire in its specific quality
- **Low signal contradicts all higher:** Name it as "undertow" or "counter-current," not an error
- **Golden rule:** Never present contradictions as errors. Present them as creative tension — the moment's complexity and depth.

## 14. Mother's Name Interpretation

The mother's name is a **foundation overlay** — not a primary signal. It sits beneath all other signals, coloring them like soil composition affects every plant. Calculated as the Expression Number of the mother's full name. Represents the energetic environment of origin and inherited expectations.

- **Match (Mother Expr = LP):** Deep resonance between foundation and journey. "Your path feels supported by your origins."
- **Clash (tense pairing):** Creative tension that pushed self-definition. "The distance between your mother's energy and your own has been a forge."
- Never blame the mother. Use language of "foundation" and "soil," not "cause" and "effect."

### Compatibility Table

| Mother Expr | Harmonious LP | Tense LP | Neutral LP    |
| ----------- | ------------- | -------- | ------------- |
| 1           | 1, 3, 5       | 2, 6     | 4, 7, 8, 9    |
| 2           | 2, 4, 6       | 1, 5     | 3, 7, 8, 9    |
| 3           | 1, 3, 5, 9    | 4, 8     | 2, 6, 7       |
| 4           | 2, 4, 8       | 3, 5     | 1, 6, 7, 9    |
| 5           | 1, 3, 5, 7    | 2, 4     | 6, 8, 9       |
| 6           | 2, 4, 6, 9    | 1, 5     | 3, 7, 8       |
| 7           | 5, 7          | 8, 9     | 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 |

## 15. Heartbeat Symbolism

### BPM mod 5 -> Element

| BPM mod 5 | Element | Symbolic Quality                                        |
| --------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0         | Wood    | Growth, expansion — the body is reaching outward        |
| 1         | Fire    | Intensity, passion — the body is alert and radiant      |
| 2         | Earth   | Stability, groundedness — the body is balanced and calm |
| 3         | Metal   | Precision, clarity — the body is focused and sharp      |
| 4         | Water   | Depth, flow — the body is in quiet processing           |

### BPM Ranges

| Range | Meaning                                                                           |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| < 60  | Deep reserve — power in storage, like a coiled spring                             |
| 60-75 | Equilibrium — supports but does not override other signals                        |
| 76-90 | Background activation — the body is processing stress or excitement               |
| > 90  | Active state — the body insists on being heard; something is happening physically |

Lifetime beats (cumulative from birth using age-specific BPM) are existential markers. Present as: "Your heart has beaten approximately X times. Each beat is a vote for your continued existence."

## 16. Location Grounding

### Latitude Zones

| Abs. Latitude | Element | Symbolic Landscape                                |
| ------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 0-15°         | Fire    | Maximum solar exposure, intensity, vital force    |
| 16-30°        | Earth   | Fertile mid-latitudes, cultivation, stability     |
| 31-45°        | Metal   | Temperate precision, industry, clarity            |
| 46-60°        | Water   | Northern depths, introspection, long winters      |
| 61-90°        | Wood    | Extremes of light/dark, primal growth, resilience |

### Hemisphere Polarity

| Position            | Polarity | Energy                                 |
| ------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Northern (lat >= 0) | Yang     | Outward-facing, activity, visibility   |
| Southern (lat < 0)  | Yin      | Inward-facing, depth, counter-cultural |
| Eastern (lon >= 0)  | Yang     | Origins, dawn, beginning of cycles     |
| Western (lon < 0)   | Yin      | Completion, dusk, closing of cycles    |

Double-Yin (S/W, e.g. Sao Paulo): deep inward pull, natural affinity for reflection.
Double-Yang (N/E, e.g. Tokyo): strong outward momentum, collective engagement.

Location element interacts as grounding modifier: amplifies day planet if matching, cools it if clashing. When location element matches LP element affinity, the person is living in a place that supports their core journey.
